		These web posters are visual experiments with generative art elements. More often than not,
		generative art is criticized for its lack of emotional depth and impersonal results, filling a
		mere ornamental function. Hence, to avoid this central issue, I try express concrete ideas and
		concepts having generative art elements to serve a supportive role.

		My workflow usually starts with a quick sketch of the general idea on Adobe Illustrator, so I
		can have a high level picture of the composition I want to achieve. Then I implement everything
		with WebGL or Canvas2D, depending on the complexity of the piece, incorporating new ideas that
		come up during the process.
