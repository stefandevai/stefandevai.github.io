During my childhood, I used to visit a part of my family that lived in a tiny adobe house in the middle of the Huastecan woodlands of Agua Blanca de Iturbide in Hidalgo, México. Throughout the roadtrip, there was a gradual change in the landscape: starting off with shiny metal of Tlalnepantla de Baz's factories, giving way to misty paths in the middle of mountains filled with pine trees, streams and water sources. A bucolic landscape that doesn't line up with the usual arid image that foreigners have when thinking about Mexico.

Arriving at my family's house, the air would be filled with the scent of burning wood in the stove as some _tortillas_ were reheated. While we waited to eat, I was always intrigued by a black and white portrait hanging on the wall. It was my great-great-grandmother, Porfiria Pérez, Porfirita.

According to my family, she married a _señor_ (my great-great-grandfather) at a very young age during the chaos of the Mexican Revolution. She therefore wanted protection as she was an orphan and as with most conflicts, there was an even bigger risk for a woman to be violated in the military effervescence of this period [^1].

Still, I always asked myself: why didn't she just move in with someone else from her family instead of marrying someone? In which circumstances did both her parents die leaving her in such a hash situation? Sadly, no one asked her these questions while she was alive.

Lucky me, a vast quantity of Mexican archives of genealogical interest are freely and easily available on [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/)! I set up a clear objective of trying to find out why Porfitita parents died.

I logically begun this investigation from what was known by my family:

Porfiria Pérez was married to Teodoro Islas;
The marriage took place during the Mexican Revolution (1910 - 1920);
She married Teodoro at a young age compared to his;
She died during the 80s.

<Genealogy data={{
  name: 'Porifiria Pérez',
  gender: 'f',
  spouse: { name: 'Teodoro Islas', gender: 'm' },
  father: { name: 'Nestor Pérez', gender: 'm' },
  mother: { name: 'Ángela Rosales', gender: 'f' },
}} />

Using this date to search through the archives I quickly found a promising document:

<Picture src="./teodoro-yslas-y-maria-porfiria-perez-boda.jpg" width="868;768;414" alt="Porfiria Pérez and Teodoro Islas marriage certificate" original={true} />

> "En la parroquia de Metepec de la Vicaría Foranea de Tulancingo á los veinticinco días de junio de mil novecientos catorce [...] asistí al matrimonio [...] de [...] Teodoro Islas [...] de cuarenta y dos ãnos de edad [...] con María Porfíria Pérez célibe de dieciocho años de edad originaria de Agua Blanca y vecina de la Pesuña del Buey y ultimamente de Temascalillos, hija legítima de Nestor Pérez y de Angela Rosales difuntos" [^2]

It's Porfirita! Even better, the document confirms and expands on what was told by my family. Now I also know that:

The marriage took place on June 25, 1914, in the middle of the Mexican Revolution;
María Porfiria Pérez was 18 years old and Teodoro Islas was 42 years old;
Her parents names are Nestor Pérez and Ángela Rosales;
They were dead by the time of the marriage.

I continued my investigations through the online archives with this new information in mind, but without much luck this time. I was not able to locate more documents related to the life of Porfirita and I was only able to find one document regarding her parents:

<Picture src="./praxedis-perez-muerte.jpg" width="868;768;414" alt="Praxedis Pérez death certificate" original={true} />

It's a death certificate of Praxedes Pérez, Porfirita's little sister. According to the document, she died of pneumonia on October 4, 1902 at only 10 months old. Child mortality rates were considerably high among poor Mexican peasants in the beginning of the 20th century [^3].

I must say I was quite sad to read about the death of my great-great-grandmother's little sister. Also, I hit a brick wall at this point. I searched with every possible combination of information, checked other sources, but I was stuck, I couldn't find any more documents related to Porfirita's close family.

Until I took a closer look at Praxedes Pérez death certificate:

> "En Agua Blanca Cabecera del municipio de Iturbide á las 3 tres de la tarde del dia cuatro de Octubre de 1902 mil novecientos dos [...] compareció la Señora Lucas (?) Perea, viuda de 50 años de edad [...], manifestando: que hoy [...] falleció la niña Praxedis Pérez á los **10 diez meses de nacida**, hija natural de Nestor Pérez y de Angela Rosales **ya difuntos**." [^4]

It states that when the little girl died, at 10 months old, her parents were already dead. Logically, we can infer that her mom must have died at some point between Praxedes' birth — her mom must be alive at least just before giving birth — and 10 months later, at Praxedes' death.

I began reading page by page of the archives [write real name of the archives] starting on January 1902. After some time, on May 21, 1902 I finally found what I was looking for:

<Picture src="./angela-rosales-muerte.jpg" width="868;768;414" alt="Ángela Rosales death certificate" original={true} />

> "Al márgen: Número 18. Defunción de Angela Rosales accidentalmente desbarrancada. Gratis. En el pueblo de Agua Blanca, Cabecera del Municipio de Yturbide á las 3 tres de la tarde del día 21 veintiuno de Mayo de 1902 mil novecientos dos [...] compareció la Señora María Luisa Rosales [...] de 27 veintisiete años de edad, manifestando: que por las investigaciones que hizo ayudada de otras personas, hoy como á las 11 once de la mañana, encontró que su hermana Angela Rosales falleció accidentalmente desbarrancada por la vereda que conduce á San Pedrito en el lugar nombrado "La Golondrina", quien había salido desde el lunes 19 diez y nueve del presente; que es viuda de 37 treinta y siete años de edad" [^5]

That is. That's how Porfirita's mother, my great-great-great-grandmother, died. According to Luisa Rosales (Pofirita's aunt), Ángela Rosales had left her house on May 19 and, three days after, at about 11am, her body was found. She died tragically after falling down from a cliff in a region called _La Golondrina_ while walking through a narrow pathway that leads to the village of San Pedrito.

I have many childhood memories of being in _La Golondrina_ region: a great waterfall, vivid green plants sprouting everywhere, cold water streams where you can find tiny pieces of obsidian and a foggy pathway that leads to San Pedrito.

I will never know what Porfirita felt after losing her dad, Nestor Pérez, her mom, Ángela Rosales, and her little sister, Praxedes Pérez, in the span of a few months while being only 5 or 6 years old. Also, in this period the economical situation was pretty harsh in her village, the revindications of the Mexican Revolution might have come with a mix of fear and hope for a poor peasant teenager. I think I finally begin to understand why she decided to marry someone.

While some questions were answered, others are still open for further investigation:

What happened to Porfirita's dad?
Why didn't she go to live with her aunt, Luisa Rosales?
Did Ángela Rosales really fell from that cliff or was it a suicide?

Well, actually I might never have the answers to these questions.

This morning I visited Agua Blanca de Iturbide's small cemetery. I thought that maybe I could find more leads to my investigation written in the graves. But, sadly, Porfirita's cheap iron cross has already rusted away.
